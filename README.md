# project_two
This project was created for the NYC General Assembly Web Development Immersive in the Lemon cohort of the March 2015 class. 

We've been tasked with building out a zombie diner for Rick, our client who has decided to try and move in on the lucrative post-apocalyptic cuisine culture that has emerged suddenly.

As the [origin](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zombie) of zombies is possibly [Kimbundu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimbundu), Rick has wisely decided to serve mostly [Angolan fare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angolan_cuisine).
